# Double-LinkedList
A doubly linked list is a more complex data structure than a singly linked list, but it offers several advantages. The main advantage of a doubly linked list is that it allows for efficient traversal of the list in both directions. This is because each node in the list contains a pointer to the previous node and a pointer to the next node.
